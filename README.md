Reflection: The purpose of this project was to mimic an existing websites using the the necessary knowledge and the understanding of HTML and CSS. In addition to just using what we understand, we are learning during coding. This reinforces the skill of learning how to learn on your own. This skill is essential because it focuses on self-determination and self-sufficiency.
Furthermore, I learned how to plan my time wisely. I plan out my workflow so I can finish the project in time. I chose DeltaMath because it was one of my most used websites.
